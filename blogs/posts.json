    "content": "<p>When working with Adobe Analytics, understanding Props and Evars is essential for collecting and analyzing website data. While both capture information, they serve distinct purposes.</p> <p>**Props (Traffic Variables):** Props are temporary data points associated with a specific tracking call. They provide basic information about the user's visit, such as page name, referrer, and timestamp. Props don't persist beyond the tracking call and aren't used in reports or analysis.</p> <p>**Evars (Event Variables):** Evars are more granular data points associated with user interactions or events. They can capture details like product purchases, form submissions, or video plays. Evars have a configurable lifespan and are used for analysis and reporting.</p> <p>**Choosing the Right Variable:** Use Props for basic traffic data that doesn't require long-term analysis. Use Evars for capturing user actions and interactions that contribute to your website goals.</p>",
